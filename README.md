Usage:

1. Adjust the _edf path_, _dataset_, and _psgID_ in the cfg of onekey_estimate_edf.py.
(It is recommended to test the HPAP1 data or the testset in swin_merge/prepared_data to prevent data leakage.)

2. Run onekey_estimate_edf.py.



Example Output:

	Dataset: HPAP1
	EDF: \\192.168.31.100\Data\13_公开数据集\公开数据集\nsrr\homepap\polysomnography\edfs\lab\full\homepap-lab-full-1600001.edf
	CA = 52.0yr
	BA_5min = 47.4±3.8yr
	BA = 48.8yr
